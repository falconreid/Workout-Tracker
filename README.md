# FitBytes: Workout-Tracker

This is a Workout Tracking App using Node, MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose, Heroku

## How It Works

When the user loads the page, they are given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user can:

- Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the Dashboard page.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
